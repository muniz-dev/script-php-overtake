# script-php-overtake

A simple PHP algorithm that calculates how many years it will take for Juca to surpass Chico in height.

## Description

Chico is 1.50m tall and grows 2 centimeters per year.  
Juca is 1.10m tall but grows 3 centimeters per year.  

This script determines how many years it will take for Juca to become taller than Chico, using a basic while loop and arithmetic operations.

It's a great introductory challenge for practicing conditional logic and loops in PHP.

## How to Run

Make sure you have PHP installed on your system.  
Then, run the script via terminal:

```bash
php script.php
